## About this Repository
This repository contains a simple project that was created as an opportunity to practice my newly acquired Angular skills. The project is a simple TODO list application that allows users to view, and add tasks.

One of the main objectives of this project was to gain experience working with API endpoints, as I was previously used to working with Thymeleaf in a monolith architecture.

## Technical stack
The project was built using Angular as the frontend framework and Java(Spring) as the backend framework. The database used is MySQL.
